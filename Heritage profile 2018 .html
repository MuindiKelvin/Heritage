<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><u>THE SUCCESFUL 15
YEARS ACHIEVEMENTS OF HERITAGE OF FAITH &amp; HOPE CHIDREN’S HOME AND SCHOOL</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i><u>INTRODUCTON &amp; BACKGROUND</u></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>As what Teresia has been talking
about in various forums .The vision of Heritage of Faith and Hope Children’s
Home came about in way of obeying our vow “God bless us and we shall touch and
transform a life of a needy person”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>In the beginning of the year 2002, Joseph
&amp; Teresia identified a needy group of boys and girls who were sleeping and
living in the streets of Nairobi near the office where they used to work with
an insurance company.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Teresia started cooking for these
young ones praying with them and trying to build a relationship with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Their needs then were food, clothing
and shelter. After feeding them for some months, we identified the most needy
cases and especially those who were total orphans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>After they agreed to be taken out
of the streets and be kept somewhere for rehabilitation, we relocated 38 of
them at a place called Athi River which is an outskirt of Nairobi  where we
found a 12 roomed facility which we could be able to maintain in paying rent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>This is when we started the process
of Registering the Charitable Children’s Institution (Heritage of Faith and
Hope Children’s Rehabilitation Centre) as per the law of Kenya authorizes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>As we had stated there before, the
need then was food, clothing and shelter. We also needed a few staff who could
assist in rehabilitating them and putting in them a sense of responsibility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>By then not many knew about what we
were doing apart from a few who were very close to us. We were therefore using
our little resources.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>We thank God for Mr.Eliud Mambo of
Ambassador Development Agency who is also a very close friend of ours and also
our mentor in various areas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>When we were in dare need of
beddings Eliud brought his friends,(Dr Michael and Kay Johnson) who brought
some mattresses, blankets and bed sheets which were enough for the number of
children we had by then (46).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>In the year 2003, Teresia was
invited to attend a Partners Worldwide Conference in California where she was
supposed to share her testimony on how we started our meat business and later
on children’s home. After Mr.Rod Huisken and his wife Char Huisken whom had met
Teresia in 2001 at Chicago heard about the vision of Heritage, they became
interested in earring more and God gave them the burden of partnering with
Heritage of Faith in the feeding of the children at the orphanage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>The Rod Huisken’s family therefore
started donating US Dolars 2,000 being 50 % of the feeding then.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b> Note:</b> By then we had 50
orphans under our care and 38 of them were admitted in a local public primary
school where they were given classes according to each one’s ability. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>There were others who joined some
vocational training where they undertook various courses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>In the same year, the needs of
taking some children to high came up and therefore we look the first eight
students to various high school schools.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Since we did have the money to pay
school fees, we started talking to various friends who started to know about
Heritage of Faith and what we were doing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>A few of them came forward and
supported us in this exercises. To date, most of these young ones have
graduated from various universities and colleges with various degrees and
Diplomas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>By and by, the local community i.e.
companies, religions, organizations and some family members started visiting
the children’s home and therefore the issue of feeding and clothing has not
been a major challenge although sometimes the cost of living in Kenya has been
a challenge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>In the year 2005, the family of Rod
Huisken visited Heritage of faith for the first time and found that the
facility where the children were staying was so much congested because the
number of the kids had increased.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>By the Grace of God Rod decided to
relocate the children from a 12 roomed facility to a 33 roomed one where he
continued to pay for the rent and at the same time sending the money he used to
send there before for feeding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>At the same year (2005), our Local
Authority through the Mayor and his team allocated Heritage of faith a 3 acre
piece of land where Rod Huisken’s Famly visited.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Heritage of faith had also started
a Christian based primary school and our children were relocated from the
public primary school to our Heritage of Faith Christian School.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>By then, the challenges of Heritage
of Faith had shifted from feeding and clothing to education because we had to
employ qualified and trained teachers in our school and the number of those who
were joining high school was growing year by year. Therefore, most of our
resources have been going towards education because this s the only gift one
can be able to give to these children so as to be self-reliant in future. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we speak today a number of them are now earning for their
living and thus give them a hope and future.</p>

MAJOR CHALLENGE</u></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:4.5pt;line-height:150%'>Currently, our
major area of need is the high cost of high school/college fees for the big
number which has continued to join both high schools and colleges where the
estimates are as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;line-height:150%'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Annual high school boarding fees and upkeep @ Kshs.69,000 (US

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><i>OUR FUTURE VISION</i></b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>To put up presentable classrooms
     in this location where the school shall play a role of an income
     generating project because our neighborhood community are of a class which
     can be able to pay good amount of money as school fees.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><i>NOTE:</i></b> We have already
started the school using some rooms of the hostels and that community has shown
great interest of bringing their children to us going by our firm Christian
foundation which many local schools do not provide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>It is in this position that we are
inviting other partners who can come forward and partner with the vision of
Heritage of Faith which is to give home and hope to orphans and vulnerable
children by transforming their lives through giving them love, care, protection
and above all giving them quality education which will enable them to be
self-reliant in future. </p>
